        * ESP32 attached to the left side of the frame.
        * Slots for GSM module and a push button.

    => Back of the Frame: A battery holder at the back of the frame for even weight distribution.

    Adjustable Design: Adjustable strap or extendable parts for a secure fit./ regular head size(15 or 16)

    Cable Management: Make the frame double-layered and the outer layer should be removable. In between, the layers should have half inches of gap. Keep in mind there are other components on both sides.
